# Short Dog Winery
✨ _A place where all your wine dreams come true_ ✨ 

An assortment of bubbles and red, this wine bar does not disapoint. While selection may be limited when the owner has a stressful day, rest assured, it will be re-stocked once they have time to scour the deals on the interwebz. Selection also comes from hand-crafted sourcing of local PNW wineries to highlight the regions nearby and of course the pairings. 

Pairings include a selection of charcuterie and chocolate, when the owner has time to stock. You can finish your time with more wine or a lovely Nespresso pod if the mood takes you. 

All wine must be consumed on-premise, with an extra tip of belly rubs to the Short Dog Qween.
